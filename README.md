# Comparing the performance of optimization algorithms and backpropagation on artificial neural network parameter trainig
In this repo an artificial neural network's weights are optimized with artificial bee colont algorithm and particle swarm optimization algorithms and backpropagation algorithm. After the training phase the result are compared base to the mean squarred error. 

## What we can do with this application
This app has an graphical user interface where we could specify our neural network architecture, input data but could aslo select it from an existing file, choose the activation function. We could also give the parameters of the three algorithms that are used to train the weights. After given the parameters that is required to the train phase we could start our traing phase where the weights get optimized. 

## Note : 
This code was written for my engineering graduating paper. Feel free to use it, don't forget to drop a star!
